  name: Windows/Doors and Climate Control
  description: This automation helps manage your heating or cooling systems based
    on window or door sensor activity, conserving energy by suspending climate control
    when a window/door is open and restoring settings after user-defined delays for
    opening and closing the window/door(s).
